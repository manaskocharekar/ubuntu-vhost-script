# Ubuntu Virtual Host script
This script is to create a virtual host on Aache server in Ubuntu and enable it with a single command
Run this command from the terminal:
```
sudo bash vhos.sh sample.local
```
Where ```sample.local``` is the name of the website that you want to create a virtual host for
This will create the directory, add an index file and then create a virtual host as well as enable it for you.
Once the code runs just go to ```sample.local ``` in your browser and voila!!

### Cheers!!
